# Web Authentication Portal (Placeholder)

This directory will eventually contain the browser-based experience that mirrors
the WalletConnect flow for users who prefer to authenticate through a web
portal. Planned capabilities include:

- Rendering the QR challenge produced by the helper service
- Allowing browser wallets (e.g., Polkadot JS extension) to sign challenges
- Displaying session status back to users and the PAM module

Implementation will start once the WalletConnect CLI flow is hardened.
